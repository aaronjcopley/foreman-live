Foreman Live CD
===============

Foreman Live CD is a Foreman pre-installed live appliance for Proof of Concept
projects.

Usage
-----

http://downloads.theforeman.org/livecd/nightly/

Download and boot the image from CD/DVD or USB stick.

Building
--------

To prepare CentOS 7 kickstart do:

  $ ./build-livecd fdi-centos7.ks

To build the image (make sure you have at least 1 GB free space in /tmp):

  $ sudo ./build-livecd-root

The image is built in /tmp directory because in most modern distributions this is
mapped to memory. This is intentional, so make sure you have enough RAM or you can
experience some swapping. Alternatively, change the temp directory in the scripts.

Downstream
----------

This repostirory is downstream friendly for koji. The generated fdi-image.ks
kickstart file is self-containing. First of all, run the initial script and
provide empty base kickstart without any repositories (they will be added via
koji:

  $ ./build-livecd fdi-empty.ks

Then simply build the image from kickstart called fdi-image.ks:

  koji spin-livecd \
    fdi-image-rhel_7_0 \
    $(cat root/usr/share/fdi/VERSION) \
    --release $(cat root/usr/share/fdi/RELEASE) \
    --repo=http://my.repo/1 \
    --scratch \
    my-tag-image
    x86_64 \
    fdi-image.ks
